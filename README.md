# Summary
Based on the classification metrics I would suggest using the AdaBoost Classifier. All of the models performed well on the precision metric (the values classified as positive, were indeed all actually positive.) The differences ocurred in the models' Recall/ Sensitivity (the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify all of the positive values within the dataset. In the AdaBoost classifier all of the positive values were identified. In this instance, identifying the risk to the company is more financially important than erring on the side of caution and mistakenly labeling someone a risk when they are not.
